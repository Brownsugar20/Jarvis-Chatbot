This project is a Python-based console chatbot named “Jarvis”, designed to interact with users by responding to their text inputs. It operates by :-

•	Storing user inputs and corresponding bot replies in a JSON file 'bot.json' enabling quick and structured responses based on specific keywords or phrases.

•	Evaluates user messages by checking the response based on matching keywords and required words in the JSON file.

•	Utilizes random fallback replies “random_responses.py” when user input doesn't match predefined responses, ensuring continuity in conversation.

•	Continuously interacts with users through a console-based input/output system “main.py”.
